## About Me

Hi, I’m Baraka   
I’m a detail-oriented Python developer with a focus on clean GUI design using Tkinter and robust database integration via MySQL.  
This project grew out of my passion for building intuitive, efficient tools that solve real-world problems.  
Feel free to explore the code—and reach out if you'd like to connect!
